Pytest 
    - most popular python package for testing 
    - basis for rich ecosystem of testing plugins and extensions 
    - Not unittest 
    - Need to install

            pip install -U pytest

            $ pytest --version
            pytest 8.3.3

    - pytest will run all files of the form test_*.py or *_test.py in
      the current directory and its subdirectories.
    - pytest provides Builtin fixtures/function arguments to request arbitrary resources, like a unique temporary directory:

    - commands

        pytest --version    # shows where pytest was imported from
        pytest --fixtures   # show available builtin function arguments
        pytest -h | --help # show help on command line and config file options

    - Running pytest can result in six different exit codes:
        Exit code 0 All tests were collected and passed successfully
        Exit code 1 Tests were collected and run but some of the tests failed
        Exit code 2 Test execution was interrupted by the user
        Exit code 3 Internal error happened while executing tests
        Exit code 4 pytest command line usage error
        Exit code 5 No tests were collected

    - To stop the testing process after the first (N) failures:
        pytest -x           # stop after first failure
        pytest --maxfail=2  # stop after two failures
