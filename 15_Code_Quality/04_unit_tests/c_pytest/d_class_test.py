Purpose: Grouping the test functions
    - Test cases can be binded in a single class
    - Naming convention
        - class name  should start with 'Test'
        - methods names should start with 'test_'
        - Else they will be skipped

"""
Grouping tests in classes can be beneficial for the following reasons:
    • Test organization
    • Sharing fixtures for tests only in that particular class
    • Applying marks at the class level and having them implicitly apply to all tests
